<h2>Systematic Strategy to Solve Coding Poblems:</h2>

1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.

2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.

3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.

4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.

5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.

6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

**Linear Search Algorithm**
Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

**Binary Search Algorithm**
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
